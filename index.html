I wish you a merry Christmas
I wish you a merry Christmas
I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year
I tidings we bring to you and your kin
I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year
Don't bring me some figgy pudding
Don't bring me some figgy pudding
Don't bring me some figgy pudding
Or bring it next year
Good tidings I bring to you and your kin
I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year
